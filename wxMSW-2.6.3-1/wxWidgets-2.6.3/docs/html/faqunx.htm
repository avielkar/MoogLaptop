<h3><a name="makefile">How do I write a Unix makefile for my program?</a></h3>

The simplest way to write a makefile is to copy
<tt>samples/minimal/makefile.unx</tt> from the wxWidgets distribution and
adapt it to your needs. Notice that you should <i>not</i> use
<tt>Makefile</tt> file from the same directory as it only works for the
samples because it assumes that the program being built is inside wxWidgets
source tree.
<p>
The <tt>makefile.unx</tt> files use <tt>wx-config</tt> instead and are more
flexible. The minimal makefile has comments inside it explaining how to adapt
it for your program.



<h3><a name="configlog">configure failed with mysterious error, what to do?</a></h3>

If you get an error from <tt>configure</tt>, please look in the generated
<tt>config.log</tt> file and try to find the test which failed (it might be not
at the very end of the file) there, usually it will contain enough information
to help you solve the problem. If this is not the case and you post a question
about it to a mailing list, please be <strong>sure</strong> to include the
relevant parts of this file as well as configure output in your message.
